This folder contains the code used for developing a counter of people going in and out of a store, using OpenCV.
The person class is what describes the properties a person should have and how to identify a person in an image.
There is also an implementation for detecting multiple people at the same time in a frame.
To test run the code, open your terminal and type
$ python3 detector.py
In order to test the scripts on a custom video, just change the cap varialble at the start of the script and replace the file name
with the path to your custom video.
Comments are appreciated :)
